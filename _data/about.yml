  Hey, I'm Phil — or Fr3akazo1d if you're in the right circles.
  I spend my days breaking into systems to figure out how to defend them better. Red Team operations, infrastructure design, custom tooling — that's my thing. Coffee and Monster Energy keep me going, and there's always a HackTheBox lab running somewhere in the background.
  When I'm not breaking things professionally, I'm probably breaking them at home. My Proxmox cluster (3 nodes) is constantly getting tweaked, my Wi-Fi setup has seen more changes than I can count, and yes... I've accidentally taken down the home internet more times than my wife would like. It's always DNS. Except when it's not DNS — then it's still DNS.
  Real life? Married with two kids, a dog, and two cats. Free time is rare, but when I get it, I'm either in the homelab or playing Minecraft with my oldest son. Sometimes both.
  The only device in my house with perfect uptime? The coffee machine.

focus_areas:
  - Red Team Operations & Adversary Emulation
  - Offensive Infrastructure (Proxmox, C2, VPN setups)
  - Custom Tool Development & Automation
  - Exploit Development & Reverse Engineering
  - Continuous Learning (HackTheBox, HTB Academy, HackSmarter)
  - Homelab Tinkering (usually breaking something)

motto: "Sometimes I feel like giving up, then I remember I have a lot of people to prove wrong."
motto2: "Root is not a privilege. It's a mindset."
