  I’m Phil — but in the wild, you’ll find me as Fr3akazo1d.
  Fueled by coffee ☕, Monster Energy ⚡, and mate 🍵 — because uptime matters.
  I break systems, not for chaos, but to make them bulletproof.
  Offensive security is my battlefield, Red Team ops my weapon of choice.
  I design and maintain Red Team infrastructure, build custom tools, and sharpen my edge with exploit development.
  Always learning, always evolving — from HackTheBox Pro Labs, HTB Academy, and HackSmarter to a never-ending to-do list that looks like an infinite recon scan.
  If it runs code, I’ll find a way in. If it’s patched, I’ll craft the exploit.

  Beyond the Terminal
  Off the cyber grid, life runs its own high-availability cluster.
  I’ve got a loving wife ❤️, two awesome kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, a dog 🐕, and two cats 🐈🐈 running their own chaos ops.
  Add a house to maintain 🏠, and yeah… free time is basically a zero-day exploit.
  When I do find a gap in the schedule, I fire up Minecraft with my oldest son — building worlds instead of pwning them.
  And if I get some time just for me?
  You’ll catch me in my homelab, tweaking Wi-Fi and LAN like a live exploit chain.
  Breaking configs, optimizing performance, and occasionally nuking the internet at home (my wife is definitely not thrilled when “upgrade” = outage 😅).
  Oh, and yes — I run my own Proxmox cluster (3 nodes strong 💪), play with tool development, and keep a Pi-hole for DNS (which my wife refuses to use because Google Ads must survive on her phone 🤷‍♂️).
  Plus, grinding through HackTheBox Pro Labs, HTB Academy, and HackSmarter — all while staring at a to-do list that looks like an endless recon scan.
  And yes… the most reliable device in my entire home network? The coffee machine. Zero downtime, maximum throughput.

  focus_areas:
    - Red Team Operations & Adversary Emulation
    - Offensive Infrastructure Engineering (Proxmox Cluster, C2, VPN)
    - Custom Tool Development & Automation
    - Exploit Development & Reverse Engineering
    - Security Research & Vulnerability Hunting
    - Continuous Learning (HackTheBox Pro Labs, HTB Academy, HackSmarter)
    - Homelab Experiments (Wi-Fi/LAN tweaks, Pi-hole DNS, breaking & fixing configs)
    - Loving Wife ❤️ — Mission Control, keeps the chaos contained
    - Two Kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 — Junior Operators, always in active mode
    - Dog 🐕 — Physical Security, alerts on every packet (and squirrel)
    - Two Cats 🐈🐈 — Stealth Agents, operating in silent mode
    - House Maintenance 🏠 — Real-world patching, uptime never guaranteed
    - Minecraft Missions 🎮 — Co-op ops with my oldest son, building instead of breaking
    - Energy Stack: Coffee ☕ + Monster ⚡ + Mate 🍵 — because even hackers need redundancy

motto: "Sometimes I feel like giving up, then I remember I have a lot of people to prove wrong."
