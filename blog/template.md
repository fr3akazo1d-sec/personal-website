### Subsection

You can have nested sections for better organization.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with more details
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

### Ordered Lists

2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Examples

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple Python function"""
    print("Hello, fr3akazo1d!")
    return True

# Call the function
hello_world()
```

```bash
# Bash commands
echo "Testing my blog post"
cd /home/fr3akazo1d
ls -la
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('fr3akazo1d');
```

## Blockquotes
